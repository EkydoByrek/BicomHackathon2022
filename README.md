# BicomHackathon2022
Code for the  key-value type database my team and I created for the 2022 Bicom Hackathon
The code is meant to create a special type of a key-value database my team I came up with (The uploaded images were used for a visual representation of our idea)
The Key type is fixed (string), the value is generic.
A part of code is left unused because of a lack of time for bugfixing, the idea was to have the option to upload data via file, and to save data on files.
